# Data Visualizer

Welcome to my Data Visualizer project. This initiative was undertaken to deepen my understanding of various algorithms. While the implementation of additional algorithms is ongoing, I wanted to share the initial version with you.

## Installation

To set up the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashton-Carter/DataVisualizer.git
   cd DataVisualizer
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run main.py

Thank you for your interest in my project. I look forward to sharing further developments as they become available.
